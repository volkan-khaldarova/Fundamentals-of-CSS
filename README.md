## 📖 About The Project

This repository serves as a portfolio of my progression in Front-End development, specifically focusing on mastering **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets). The majority of the content here follows the **Codecademy** curriculum and includes various projects coded to reinforce visual design and layout concepts.

By exploring this repository, developers or recruiters can observe:
* Understanding of the **Box Model** and positioning.
* Implementation of modern layouts using **Flexbox** and **Grid**.
* **Responsive Design** principles for different screen sizes.
* Clean and organized CSS code structure.

## 🛠️ Built With

These projects are built using the core technologies of web styling:

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure to support CSS selectors.
* **CSS3:** Styling, typography, colors, and advanced layout techniques (Flexbox/Grid).
